The Alibaba login form, developed using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, was created with the specific aim of fulfilling the requirements for my final exam project as instructed by my lecturer. HTML was employed to construct the form's structure, CSS was utilized to maintain its style and aesthetics, and JavaScript was implemented to provide validation for the form's text fields, including checks for password strength and proper email format, among other functionalities

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm">

    </div>
